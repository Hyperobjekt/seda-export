        <p>The Educational Opportunity Project has derived these data and visualizations from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA), which is the first national database of academic performance in the U.S.</p>
        <p>The SEDA data are based on the standardized accountability tests in math and English Language Arts (ELA) administered annually by each state to all public school students in grades 3-8 in each school year from 2008-09 through 2015-16. In these years, third- through eighth-graders in U.S. public schools took roughly 350 million standardized math and ELA tests.</p>
        <p>The Educational Opportunity Project harnesses these and other data to help scholars, policymakers, educators, and parents learn how to improve educational opportunity for all children.</p>
