          <p>The Educational Opportunity Project has derived these data and visualizations from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA), which is the first national database of academic performance in the U.S.</p><p>The SEDA data are based on the standardized accountability tests in math and English Language Arts (ELA) administered annually by each state to all public school students in grades 3-8 in each school year from 2008-09 through 2015-16. In these years, third- through eighth-graders in U.S. public schools took roughly 350 million standardized math and ELA tests.</p><p>The Educational Opportunity Project harnesses these and other data to help scholars, policymakers, educators, and parents learn how to improve educational opportunity for all children.</p>

          <p class="body-smaller">Average student test scores are influenced by children’s opportunities to learn in their homes, in their neighborhoods, in the childcare, preschool, and after-school programs they attend, from their peers and friends, and in their schools. Because of all these influences, average test scores are not a good way to assess how much children learn in schools. But they are a good way to assess the average set of educational opportunities available to children in a community. Where average scores are low, students have fewer opportunities to learn. Schools are better evaluated using Learning Rates, which measure how much student scores improve while they are in school.</p>
